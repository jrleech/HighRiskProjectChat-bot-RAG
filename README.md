# Medical Chatbot (COVID-19 Guidelines)

A chatbot that answers questions based on WHO's COVID-19 management document. I have attempted to create my own LLM. I resorted to using a Hugging Face / ChatGPT backend becasue the LLM was not being trained to a high enough standard. In the future I will develop the LLM to be much better and host the website for public use. 

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Add your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

3. Download the WHO COVID-19 Guidelines PDF manually and place it in `data/` folder.

4. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. to train and run the model 
    cd /Users/jacksonleech/Downloads/Leech_Jack_Final_Proj
    python MyLLM.p
